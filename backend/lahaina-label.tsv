disaster	"I don’t have any family on Maui but one of my best friends used to live there and Lahaina, for all it’s tourist trap-ness, was also rich with historical significance. The Buddhist Hongwanji church burned down not to mention people’s homes and livelihoods. Just awful. The climate crisis is killing us"
other	"*Lahaina is very DRY.

smh"
disaster	"Terribly sad about Lahaina. My heart goes out to all the residents, and business owners."
disaster	I think like… most of the town from the highway to the water is gone. The majority of Lahaina.
disaster	"Not to be a weirdo but as someone who very much believes in climate change, we still need to be accurate in how we frame these fires. Lahaina is very. Wildfires/brush fires are extremely normal there. It was always a town at risk and extreme wind was a recipe for disaster. It's heartbreaking."

other	"But online conversations have WAY more impact on the culture than in-person ones. A viral post can reach thousands of people, far more than anyone could meet by knocking on doors. That's why the Democratic Party arranges for DM groups to spread its messaging, and why MAGA do similar. It's effective."

Because zombies are mindless servants of a goal, usually to feed or to spread, or R under someone's control.
