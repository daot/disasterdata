Flask-React run tutorial
1. npm install
2. pip install flask flask_cors nltk pandas geopy
2. These dependencies should already be in the react-dashboard but if not:
	npm install chart.js react-d3-cloud react-chartjs-2 (may need to use --save and --legacy-peer-deps if popping up with dependency tree issue)
3. open one terminal (with env connected), change to backend folder, and use python main.py
4. open another terminal, cd to react-dashboard, npm start
